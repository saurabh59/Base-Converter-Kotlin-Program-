How to convert from any base to any other base?

Step 1. Divide the given number into integer part and fractional part.
Step 2. Convert the integer number to decimal base.
        2a. Reverse the number.
        2b. Iterate through the number digit by digit.
        2c. If digit is character, convert it into corresponding digit by subtracting the digit from 'A'
        and adding 10 to the result.
        2d. Once we have digit as number, we multiply with base raised to power(from to 0 to n)
        2e. Take sum of all the result till 2d for each digit.
Step 3. Now, divide the decimal to target base, until quotient is greater than or equal to target base, keep collecting
remainder.
    Step 3a. Here, if remainder is greater than 10, we need to convert it to character, by adding 'A' to difference of
    remainder and 10.
    Step 3b. Append the remainder.


Similarly, we can convert fractional part as well, difference being that, this we will multiply with negative powers of
source base while converting from given base to decimal base.

In the program , we needed to convert only till 5 decimal places.
